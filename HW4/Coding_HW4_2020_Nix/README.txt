########## Some steps to take! ##########

Hi Prof, so the following are some little instructions:

For AUGMENTATION HOMEWORK:
	1. Change directory into 'augmentation_HW' by running
		>>>> cd augmentation_HW

	2. Depending on your preference
		i. You can run jupyter notebook and open up 'augmentation.ipynb'.
		ii. You can open up augmentation.py instead and run the command in terminal
			>>>> python augmentation.py
		    when you wish to run the code! 

	3. In both cases, given that I cannot send you the whole dataset, you have to change
	   a file path under the 'run()' function to set the path to the folder in the dataset containing the images:
		i. Change the contents of the variable 'imgpath' to link it to the images root folder

	4. And that is it! You can now run the code.

	5. Report for this assignment is in the 'augmentation_HW' folder.

For TRANSFER LEARNING HOMEWORK:
	1. Change directory into 'transfer_learning_HW' by running
		>>>> cd transfer_learning_HW

	2. In total there are 3 notebooks and 3 .py files for the 3 different modes of training, A, B and C.
	   Depending on your preference
		i. For Mode A:
			You can run jupyter notebook and open up 'transfer_mode_A.ipynb'.

			If you prefer to run the file from the command line instead, you can
			open up 'transfer_mode_A.py' instead and to run it, run in terminal the command
				>>>> python transfer_mode_A.py
		ii. For Mode B:
			You can run jupyter notebook and open up 'transfer_mode_B.ipynb'.

			If you prefer to run the file from the command line instead, you can
			open up 'transfer_mode_B.py' instead and to run it, run in terminal the command
				>>>> python transfer_mode_B.py
		ii. For Mode C:
			You can run jupyter notebook and open up 'transfer_mode_C.ipynb'.

			If you prefer to run the file from the command line instead, you can
			open up 'transfer_mode_C.py' instead and to run it, run in terminal the command
				>>>> python transfer_mode_C.py

	3. In both cases, given that I cannot send you the whole dataset, you have to change
	   a file path under the 'run()' function to set the path to the folder in the dataset containing the images:
		i. Change the contents of the variable 'img_root' to link it to the images root folder
		ii. Change the contents of the variable 'traintxt_root to link it to the trainfile.txt file.
		iii. Change the contents of the variable 'valtxt_root to link it to the valfile.txt file.
		iv. Change the contents of the variable 'testtxt_root to link it to the testfile.txt file.

	4. And that is it! You can now run the code.

	5. Report for this assignment is in the 'transfer_learning_HW' folder.
