######## The following are just some little instructions ########

There are two alternatives:
1. If you prefer Jupyter notebook:
	a. Run jupyter notebook on your terminal where the directory is the root directory of 	the “Coding_HW3_2020_Nix” folder

	b. Enter the folder "task_1" and open up "DL3_Coding_Task1.ipynb".

	c. Some dependencies you want to note for the environment (python 3.7) will be the 	same ones that were included within the "pytorch_logreg_gdesc_studentversion.py" code.

2. If you prefer just running the python files:
	a. Change directory in your terminal to the root of the “Coding_HW1_2020_Nix” folder.

	b. Change directory into the "task_1" folder.

	c. Run “python DL3_Coding_Task1.py” to run the training. The results will be seen in 		the terminal.
